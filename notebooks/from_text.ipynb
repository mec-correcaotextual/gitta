    "While the default values should already work, you can give some more hints to GITTA about your expected grammar using its parameters.\n",
    "The most important are:\n",
    "- `relative_similarity_threshold`: 0 = join slots if at least one value overlaps, 1 = never join slots unless their values 100% overlap.\n",
    "- `Ã llow_empty_string`: True if slots are allowed to map to empty strings, False if you want at least one token from every slot. Helpful to simply and easily correct resulting grammars.\n",
    "- `max_depth`: The maximum depth the internal template tree is allow to become at any point, thus also limiting how deep your grammar can be.\n",
    "- `use_best_merge_candidate`: Forces GITTA to work optimally, but lose some performance. Turning this boolean off can increase speed, but might result in slightly off grammars.\n",
    "- `prune_redudant`: Prunes nodes of the template tree if all their children are already covered by other sibling nodes. Turning this off might make the grammar have more paths to generate the same string."
